## <Prework Coding Boot Camp>

## Description
My motivation is to develop my software programming skills to the next level in order to help my professional career, especially since coding skills like JavaScript, CCS, and HTML are in high demand across various industries. I am 100% excited about the opportunity to learn a lot more coding skills from this class. 

The project is built to help boot camp students (including me) learn fundamental coding concepts and skills including GitHub, JavaScript,  CSS, HTML, README, etc. 

HTML code defines the structure and content of our webpage. It includes sections for different topics (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) where we can add our own notes. It also includes references to external CSS and JavaScript files to style and adds functionality to the webpage. JavaScript code snippet demonstrates the basic use of JavaScript to select a random topic from an array and determine which topic to study first  CSS code defines the styling for different elements in an HTML document, including the header, footer, headings, images, lists, paragraphs, and elements. By applying these styles, we can achieve a specific visual layout and appearance for our HTML content. 

I learned how to use the command line to set up SSH keys and licenses, and to complete Git flow and Git version control. Learned how to build a simple web application by creating code with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript including creating arrays, for loops, and functions; adding variables to JavaScript files, styling using class attributes; creating a professional project README, etc.
